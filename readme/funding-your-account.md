# Funding your account

To start building on ICE testnet node, you can get UNIT tokens from [faucet](https://discord.gg/dzmePx2UZd), in Web3 labs Discord Channel. Use dev-ice-faucet channel to get testnet tokens.

Just paste the following command in the channel:

```
// !send $substrate_wallet_address

// Example
!send 5CiPPseXPECbkjWCa6MnjNokrgYjMqmKndv2rSnekmSK2DjL
```

Read more about the faucet [here](../ice-testnet-details/faucet.md).
