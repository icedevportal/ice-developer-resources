# View Blocks and Events

* To view recent blocks and events, select the `Explorer` option from the `Network` dropdown in the Navigation Bar.&#x20;
* Click on the block number on the `recent blocks` panel on the left, to view the details of that block.&#x20;
* You can search for a particular block by its `block hash` or its `block number` from the search panel on the top-right search bar of the page.

**NOTES:**

1. _The explorer starts tracking the blockchain only after you open the app i.e. historical blocks/events will not be shown in the explorer, but you can always query them from the search bar or use the_ [_Subscan Explorer_](../ice-snow-explorer.md#snow-mainnet)_._
2. _Block hash and wallet address for Substrate and EVM are different._
