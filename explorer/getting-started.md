# Getting Started

## Installing Polkadot-js Wallet Extension

To make transactions on substrate blockchain (outside EVM), you need to have a [Polkadot.js wallet](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) which supports SNOW accounts, and ed25519, sr25519, ecdsa and ethereum signatures. The wallet extension is available for [Chromium based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium\_\(web\_browser\)) and Firefox.

## Transferring Balance

* Select **Accounts** from the **Accounts** dropdown on the Navbar.
