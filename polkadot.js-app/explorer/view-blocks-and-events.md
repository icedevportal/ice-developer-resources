# View Blocks and Events

* To view recent blocks and events, select the Explorer option from the Network dropdown in the Navigation Bar.&#x20;
* Click on the block number on the “recent blocks” panel to view the details of that block.&#x20;
* You can search for a particular block by its block hash or its block number from the search panel on the top-right of the page.

**NOTES:**

1. _The explorer starts tracking the blockchain only after you open the app i.e. historical blocks/events will not be shown in the explorer, but you can always query them from the search bar._
2. _Block hash and wallet address for Substrate and EVM are different._
