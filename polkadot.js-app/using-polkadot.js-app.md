# Using Polkadot.js App

Head over to [this link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2F51.158.117.160%3A9945#/explorer) to launch the app. ( _**Note**: If itâ€™s the first time you are loading this app with ICE testnet, you need to visit_ [_this link_](https://51.158.117.160:9945) _for your browser to download the ssl certificate. Re-open the polkadot.js app after that and it should be working_)

Now you are ready to query and interact with the ICE testnet blockchain
