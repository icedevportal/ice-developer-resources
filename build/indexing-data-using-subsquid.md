# Indexing Data using Subsquid

[**Subsquid**](https://docs.subsquid.io/) is a framework for indexing or querying data on Substrate-based blockchains. Moreover, Subsquid is an [**ETL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,\_transform,\_load) (Extract, Transform, Load) project that collects on-chain data and provides a GraphQL API to query those data.

We have already published few medium articles whose links are provided below:

[Subsquid’s documentation](https://docs.subsquid.io/) is full of useful information, and it’s the best place to start if you have questions about anything that wasn’t covered in this introductory section.
