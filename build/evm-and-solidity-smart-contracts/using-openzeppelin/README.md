# Using OpenZeppelin

OpenZeppelin is an open-source framework built on reusable Ethereum smart contracts. The framework enables smart contract developers to limit the risk of vulnerabilities in their distributed applications (dApps) by utilizing standard, tested, community-reviewed code. It provides security tools to develop, automate, and run decentralized applications. All of OpenZeppelin's contracts and libraries may be deployed without any changes because of ICE's Ethereum compatibility.

You can find more information about OpenZeppelin on their [documentation site](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/openzeppelin/).

In this article, we will look at how to create an ERC721 and ERC1115 standard NFT tokens using openZeppelin

You can also generate a basic smart contract code using [OpenZeppelin Contract Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com).

&#x20;[OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com) is an online web-based interactive contract generating tool, which is arguably the simplest and quickest method to develop your smart contract using the OpenZeppelin library.

### OpenZeppelin Contract Wizard

As we can see, the openzeppelin contract wizard is divided into various parts:

1. &#x20;**Token standard:** This shows different standards tokens provided by the wizard
2. &#x20;**Settings:** Provides a base setting for each standard like name, symbol, pre-mint value, base URI, etc.
3. &#x20;**Features:** Provides a  list of features for every token standard
4. &#x20;**Access Control:** a list of all the access control techniques available for each token standard
5. &#x20;**Upgradability:** Provides contract upgradability features.
6. **Info:** Provides fields where people can contact the contract creator for any issue and another field for license
7. &#x20;**Code display area:** displays the smart contract code with the user-specified parameters.
