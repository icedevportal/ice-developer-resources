# EVM and Solidity Smart Contracts

ICE is built with an Ethereum-compatible layer, called [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier), which makes it possible to run Ethereum dApps on ICE blockchain. That means you can write Smart Contracts in Solidity and deploy them using your favorite Metamask wallet on ICE.
