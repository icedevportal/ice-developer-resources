# EVM and Solidity Smart Contracts

ICE is built with an Ethereum-compatible layer, called [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier), which makes it possible to run Ethereum dApps on ICE blockchain. That means you can write Smart Contracts in Solidity and deploy them using your favorite Metamask wallet on ICE.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE**: _**An EVM smart contract can be a maximum of 24KB or it will run out of gas.**_

**Reference:** [**https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/#limitations**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/#limitations)****
