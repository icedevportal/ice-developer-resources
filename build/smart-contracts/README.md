# Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a computer protocol that executes contract terms. The overarching goals are to provide security, reduce risk, and reduce the need for third parties.&#x20;

Smart contracts enable the execution of credible transactions without the involvement of third parties. These transactions can be tracked and are irreversible.&#x20;

A smart contract platform is an example of the blockchain. It can run scripts by utilizing an international network of public nodes that validate transactions without requiring users to trust one another or a central authority.

ICE, being a substrate based blockchain, supports both **EVM smart contracts** using Solidity and **Ink! smart contracts** using Rust.
