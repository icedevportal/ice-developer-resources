# Building on ICE

Here, you can find information on development tools and other information related to building on ICE.

Following are some sections that might help you get started to build:

### Connect with the Network

* Find the RPC and WSS Endpoints to [connect and interact](network-endpoints.md#network-details) with the EVM and the core ICE/SNOW Network

### Ink! Smart Contracts

* [Write, deploy and interact](ink-smart-contracts/create-and-deploy-ink-smart-contract.md) with ink! smart contracts using [Polkadot.js app](https://polkadot.js.org/apps).

### Interacting with EVM

* [Hardhat](evm/evm-and-solidity-smart-contracts/using-hardhat/): Overview on how to deploy smart contracts using Hardhat and interact with smart contracts.
* [Truffle](evm/evm-and-solidity-smart-contracts/using-truffle/): Overview on how to deploy smart contracts using Truffle and interact with smart contracts.
* [Web3.js](evm/evm-and-solidity-smart-contracts/using-web3.js/): Overview on how to deploy smart contracts using web3.js and interact with smart contracts.
* [Openzeppelin](evm/evm-and-solidity-smart-contracts/using-hardhat/): An example on how openzeppelin library can be used to write Solidity contracts on ICE.
* [Metamask:](evm/configuring-metamask.md#snow-network-configuration) Guide on how to integrate Metamask into ICE/SNOW.

### Tools

* [Faucet](faucet/): To fund your account with testnet tokens
* [Polkadot explorer](broken-reference)
* [Remix](evm/evm-and-solidity-smart-contracts/using-remix/): Guide on how to use Remix to write Solidity contracts and deploy on the ICE network

### Resources

* [Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/getting-started/overview/)&#x20;
