# Receiving Test Tokens

1. Once you have created an account, you should see something like this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (8).png>)

2\. You can click on the address name and it should pop up a menu on the right side. Use that menu to copy your address.

3\. In the ICON Discord, make sure you have the correct roles set to be able to see #ice\_testnet\_faucet like this:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (9).png>)

4\. Once you’re able to see, type `!send` followed by your copied address. You can follow other people’s comments to see the exact format: `!send someAddressHere`

![This should take a few seconds from the bot.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Untitled (10).png>)

5\. Check back on [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) to see that your address has been supplied with the amount from the faucet bot.
