### Airdrop and Tokenomics

<details>

<summary>What are the details of the airdrop and associated tokenomics?</summary>

ICX/sICX holders will be airdropped 1:1 ratio of equivalent ICE blockchain’s native ICY tokens. The airdropped $ICY will be vested over 3 years, and at least 20% of the airdropped tokens will be made available immediately. The total $ICY supply will be 25% more than the total supply of $ICX.

No. ICY token is the native token on ICE blockchain and ICE is a separate Layer-1 blockchain with its own consensus mechanism, nodes and validators.

### **Development**

<details>

<summary><strong>How can I write and deploy smart contracts on ICE?</strong></summary>

As a smart contract developer on ICE, you can either use [Ink](https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs/)! to write and deploy smart contracts on the core Substrate chain OR you can write smart contracts using Solidity and deploy them inside the ICE EVM

</details>

### **Technology**

<details>

<summary><strong>How is ICE related to ICON and Polkadot?</strong></summary>

ICE is a sister-chain of ICON. ICE will be connected with ICON using ICON’s BTP ( Blockchain Transmission Protocol ).&#x20;

ICE will compete for a parachain slot on the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling ICE to easily communicate with other Polkadot parachains.&#x20;

Thus, ICE is going to be one of the most connected blockchains.
